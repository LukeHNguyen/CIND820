Project stages:
 - Data collection and preparation: Completed
 - Model selection and training:Completed. 10 fold cross validation and two algorithm: Decision tree and Support Vector Machine
 - Model evaluation: Completed. Using MSE
 - Model optimization: In progress
    + Divide data by crop type, then select feature and build model for each
    + Feature Selection using RFE and Stepwise selection to compare which one provide better performance
    + Ensemble learning
    + Tuning the 2 models hyperparameter

Initial Results:
 - Decision tree
 - Support Vector Machine
